Recently I visited a zoo in my hometown. It was an awesome experience to be part of the
nature. I saw a lot of tigers, elephants, deer and a whole lot of other [animals](../animal/animal.md)

I was pretty thirsty. There is a lemonade stand over there.
I head over and buy some [lemonade](../drink/lemonade/lemonade.md)

Then when the owner hands me over my cup, he slips and pour all
the lemonade over me. The owner was a beautiful girl and helped
me clean out my clothes. During that time we talked for hours.
I think I am in [love](../love/love.md) with her.

I choose to get better at [English](../get-better-at-english/english.md)

After my self trolling is complete, I decide to drink the lemonade.
As I lift the lemonade to my mouth I see the tigers have broken loose.
